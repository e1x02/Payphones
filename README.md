In 2015, before beginning an overhaul of its public communications service that produced LinkNYC, the City of New York relied on 9 telecom companies to provide service to its network of public payphones. Built on the remains of Bell Telephone infrastructure, the telecoms were differentiated only by their branding. From 2000-2014, telecom companies in New York maintained a geographic monopoly, with specific areas of the city designated as certain corporate territories. 

Data on payphone installations in New York City has disintegrated. The New York City [Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITTT)](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) only published payphone datasets in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy, when payphones served as a crucial emergency infrastructure. Mark Thomas of the [Payphone-Project.com](https://www.payphone-project.com/nyc_releases_its_ppt_public_pay_telephone_dataset.html) showed that much of that initial dataset was wrong, with hundreds of missing or misplaced payphones. The data improved as the city began to decommission payphones in preparation for its LinkNYC mobile Wi-Fi stations. This data was publicly available until August 2022, three months after DoITT (mistakenly) announced that the final payphone had been removed from the city. No archival copies of this data are publicly available. 

It is now a truism that the internet has no archival backstop. This is often assumed to impact only private companies with no archival incentive, but even public archival data can easily disappear with little warning. This repository is a meager archival effort to preserve this data.

## Limitations

This data only show the location of *public* payphones. Public payphones are installed on city property or public areas and operated through city subcontracts. This does not include payphones on private property or operated separately from DoITT, such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway system. The data used in these maps is from a privately archived dataset compiled in 2015 by Mark Thomas, which I have spot-checked (~5% of the 6,000 entries distributed proportionally across the boroughs) using the coordinates and the historic imagery in Google Streetview.

## To do

- [ ] Bother DoITT for other Payphone Datasets (in progress)
- [ ] Work on an interactive map and public facing site
- [ ] Track down other forms of this same data
